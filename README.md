# Fuzz
I have wanted to try my hand at creating a programming language from scratch for some time. I decided on a somewhat whimsical way to go about it: introduce my own operator, ~=. This will let us get the fuzzy equality of two variables of the same type. We base this upon a "fuzz factor", which can be passed in as a command line argument. This tells us how much slack to give the equality comparison.

This is still in the extremely early stages of implementation, but I am iterating on it frequently.

No generative AI has been used in the creation of this project.
